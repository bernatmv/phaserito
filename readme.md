## IMPORTANT

Phaserito is heavily based on the work of [Nestor Hern√°ndez](https://github.com/nesukun) (Phasercito) and on top of the amazing [Phaser.js](http://phaser.io/) framework by [Richard Davey](https://github.com/photonstorm) of [Photonstorm](http://www.photonstorm.com/). You can find [Phaser on github](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) and contact Photonstorm [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/photonstorm) or on the [Phaser forums](http://www.html5gamedevs.com/forum/14-phaser/).

# Both a Phaser.js boilerplate with ES6 and library extension

Phaserito is a template to boost any [Phaser.js](http://phaser.io/) game development.
Phaserito can help you with your starting project structure and build process.
